## 🎓 Project Context & Motivation

This environment, **Unreal Paradise**, has been developed as my final submission for **Module 5: "Creating your Unreal Paradise"** of the **[Unreal Engine Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unreal-engine-fundamentals?specialization=epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate)** course. This course is the second part of the **[Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate#courses)** offered on Coursera.

This repository documents the development process and showcases the final result, demonstrating the application of skills learned throughout the course.

## 🎯 Overview

**Unreal Paradise** is an immersive and atmospheric stylized fantasy jungle village created in **Unreal Engine 5.5.1**. The landscape was sculpted using UE5's landscape tools, and the scene was brought to life by integrating a variety of assets from three Fab packs: **"Stylized Fantasy Provencal"** (by StylArts) for homes and a windmill; **"Stylized Nature Pack"** (by Tiny Talisman Games) for diverse trees, rocks, and foliage; and **"Landscape Backgrounds"** (by SL - Game Environments) for distant vistas.

Unreal Engine's foliage mode was extensively used to scatter trees, grasses, bushes, and rocks, creating a rich, natural feel. A custom river material enhances the water bodies, and post-processing volumes contribute significantly to the scene's beautiful aesthetic. Cinematic shots were captured using Sequencer and Cine Camera Actors, output as a PNG sequence, and then compiled into a 24-second video using Blender. This video forms the core of the course submission.

The project fulfills the requirements for the "Unreal Paradise" final assignment and serves as a portfolio piece.
