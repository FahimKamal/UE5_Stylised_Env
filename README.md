## 🎓 Project Context & Motivation

This environment, **Unreal Paradise**, was developed as my final submission for **Module 5: "Creating your Unreal Paradise"** of the **[Unreal Engine Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unreal-engine-fundamentals?specialization=epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate)** course. This course is the second part of the **[Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate#courses)** offered on Coursera.

The project has been successfully submitted to the Coursera platform, including all required materials (reference images, PureRef file, main video, and documentation). This repository documents the development process and showcases the final result, demonstrating the application of skills learned throughout the course.

## 🎯 Overview

**Unreal Paradise** is an immersive and atmospheric stylized fantasy jungle village created in **Unreal Engine 5.5.1**. The landscape was sculpted using UE5's landscape tools, and the scene was brought to life by integrating a variety of assets from three Fab packs: **"Stylized Fantasy Provencal"** (by StylArts) for homes and a windmill; **"Stylized Nature Pack"** (by Tiny Talisman Games) for diverse trees, rocks, and foliage; and **"Landscape Backgrounds"** (by SL - Game Environments) for distant vistas.

Unreal Engine's foliage mode was extensively used to scatter trees, grasses, bushes, and rocks, creating a rich, natural feel. A custom river material enhances the water bodies, and ambient sounds (natural environment, birds chirping) have been integrated to enhance immersion. Post-processing volumes contribute significantly to the scene's beautiful aesthetic. Cinematic shots were captured using Sequencer and Cine Camera Actors, output as a PNG sequence, and then compiled into a 24-second video using Blender. This video formed the core of the course submission.

The project fulfills the requirements for the "Unreal Paradise" final assignment and serves as a portfolio piece.
